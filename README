Musical Language Proofs
=======================

This proof code concerns the relationship between musical languages and concepts.
Let there be statements and concepts.
Let languages be sets of statements.
Let there be a relations `eval on statements and concepts.
Define a relation `a on languages and sets of concepts so that a language relates to a set of concepts if every statement that is a member of the language evaluates to some subset that set of concepts.

The following sentences in first order logic are provable:

1. ∀L1∀L2(a(L1 ∪ L2) ⊇ a(L1) ∩ a(L2))
2. ∀L1∀L2(a(L1 ∩ L2) ⊇ a(L1) ∪ a(L2))
3. ∀L1∀L2(a(L1) ∩ a(L2) ⊇ a(L1 ∪ L2))
4. ∀L1∀L2(a(L1) ∪ a(L2) ⊇ a(L1 ∪ L2))

Given 1 and 3:

5. ∀L1∀L2(a(L1 ∪ L2) = a(L1) ∩ a(L2))

Note that 2 and 4 are asymmetrical.  I have not found a proof of 6* or its negation.

6*. ∀L1∀L2(a(L1) ∪ a(L2) ⊇ a(L1 ∩ L2))

If sentence 6* could be proven, then the following would be true:

7*. ∀L1∀L2(a(L1 ∩ L2) = a(L1) ∪ a(L2))
