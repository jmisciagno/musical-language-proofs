Musical Language Proofs
=======================

This proof code concerns a relation `a and its properties. 
It relates sets of statements to sets of concepts.

a : (Statement -> Prop) -> (Concept -> Prop) -> Prop

The following sentences in first order logic are proven:

1. ∀s∀t(a(s ∪ t) ⊇ a(s) ∩ a(t))
2. ∀s∀t(a(s ∩ t) ⊇ a(s) ∪ a(t))
3. ∀s∀t(a(s) ∩ a(r, t) ⊇ a(s ∪ t))
4. ∀s∀t(a(s) ∪ a(r, t) ⊇ a(s ∪ t))

Given 1 and 3:

5. ∀s∀t(a(s ∪ t) = a(s) ∩ a(t))

Note that 2 and 4 are asymmetrical.

Formulas 1-5 are proven in Coq and are followed by proofs about a more general function `raise.

raise {A B} : (A -> B -> Prop) (A -> Prop) -> (B -> Prop) -> Prop
