Musical Language Proofs
=======================

This proof code concerns a function raise and its properties. 
It relates sets of statements to sets of concepts.

raise : (a -> b -> Prop) -> ((a -> Prop) -> (b -> Prop)) :=

The raise function takes a relation on types a and b, and return a function from sets of a to sets of b.  
The elements of the resultant set are those elements of b that relate to all elements of a by the input relation.

Given that `R is a relation on a and b, and `f is defined as (raise R), then the following theorems hold:

1. ∀s∀t(f(s) ∩ f(t) ⊆ f(s ∪ t))
2. ∀s∀t(f(s ∪ t) ⊆ f(s) ∩ f(r, t))
3. ∀s∀t(f(s) ∪ f(t) ⊆ f(s ∩ t))
4. ∀s∀t(f(s ∪ t) ⊆ f(s) ∪ f(r, t))
5. ∀s∀t(f(s) ∩ f(t) ⊆ f(s ∩ t))

Given 1 and 2:

6. ∀s∀t(f(s ∪ t) = f(s) ∩ f(t))
