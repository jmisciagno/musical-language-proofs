Musical Language Proofs
=======================

This proof code concerns the relationship between musical languages and emotions.
Let there be statements and affects.
Let emotions be sets of affects.
Let there be a function “eval” from statements to emotions.
Define a function “interpret” on languages and emotions so that a language means an emotion if every statement that is a member of the language evaluates to some subset of the emotion.

The following sentences in first order logic are provable:

1. ∀L1∀L2(a(L1 ∪ L2) ⊇ a(L1) ∩ a(L2))
2. ∀L1∀L2(a(L1 ∩ L2) ⊇ a(L1) ∪ a(L2))
3. ∀L1∀L2(a(L1) ∩ f(L2) ⊇ a(L1 ∪ L2))
4. ∀L1∀L2(a(L1) ∪ f(L2) ⊇ a(L1 ∪ L2))

Given 1 and 3:
5. ∀L1∀L2(a(L1 ∪ L2) = a(L1) ∩ a(L2))

Note that 2 and 4 are asymmetrical.  I have not found a proof of 6* or its negation.

6*. ∀L1∀L2(a(L1) ∪ a(L2) ⊇ a(L1 ∩ L2))

If sentence 6* could be proven, then the following would be true:

7*. ∀L1∀L2(a(L1 ∩ L2) = a(L1) ∪ a(L2))
